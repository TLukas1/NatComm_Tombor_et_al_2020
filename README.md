This repository provides code for single-cell and data analysis used in: "Single cell sequencing reveals endothelial plasticity with transient mesenchymal activation after myocardial infarction" (Nature Communications, Tombor et al. 2020)

Data is available here:
* AMI single cell sequencing Timecourse (Forte et al. 2020) https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7895/
* AMI single cell sequencing Timecourse Cdh5-CreRT2 tracing (Tombor et al. 2020)
* AMI single cell sequencing Col1a2-CreRT tracing (Tombor et al. 2020)
* AMI bulk-RNA sequencing 
* EPIC array DNA methylation analysis (Tombor et al. 2020)

Analysis has been done using Seurat (version 2.3.4 or 3.0.1). Please follow "innitial analysis" for creating Seurat objects from 10X Outputs. Please follow "Data analysis" for code associated to data presented in this study.
